        <h2 class="text-4xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why ROI Evaluation is Important</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Return on investment (ROI) is a critical metric that helps businesses assess the profitability of their investments, projects, and operations. It guides decision-making and ensures resources are allocated effectively to maximize value.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6">Overview of the Process</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
            The process of ROI evaluation involves analyzing a project's costs and benefits to determine its financial feasibility. We use techniques such as <strong>Net Present Value (NPV)</strong> and <strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</strong>, alongside market analysis and financial modeling to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6">Example: A Simple ROI Calculation</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
            For example, when evaluating an investment, we compare the projected returns with the initial cost, adjusting for time value of money using <strong>NPV</strong> or calculating the <strong>IRR</strong> to understand the potential long-term value of the project.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            A thorough market assessment is crucial for understanding a product's positioning in the market. By evaluating similar products and existing competitive products, we can estimate the projected demand and identify the risks and opportunities of introducing the new product.

            In this phase, it’s essential to break down the costs and investments required for the engineering development of the project. The goal is to ensure you understand the necessary resources and the timeline of the investments. Here are some things to keep in mind: <br><br>
            • Itemize and quantify all the resources required for the project—materials, labor, and technology costs. <br><br>
            • Organize the investment over time to understand when each phase will require funds, ensuring you have enough capital at the right times. <br><br>
            • Identify potential risks, such as delays or cost overruns, and opportunities for reducing expenses or improving efficiency. <br><br>
            • Account for the financial impact of risks and opportunities. For example, delays might add costs, while new technologies might reduce expenses. Adjust your financial projections accordingly.
