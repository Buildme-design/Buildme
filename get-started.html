        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Return on investment (ROI) is a critical metric that helps businesses assess the profitability of their investments, projects, and operations. It guides decision-making and ensures resources are allocated effectively to maximize value.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Overview of the Process</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The process of ROI evaluation involves analyzing a project's costs and benefits to determine its financial feasibility. We use techniques such as **Net Present Value (NPV)** and **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**, alongside market analysis and financial modeling to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Example: A Simple ROI Calculation</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            For example, when evaluating an investment, we compare the projected returns with the initial cost, adjusting for time value of money using **NPV** or calculating the **IRR** to understand the potential long-term value of the project.
